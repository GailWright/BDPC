            <hr>
              <p>
                Homeowner’s insurance will typically pay for any clean-up costs associated with an accidental death.&nbsp; Contractors are unable to determine which benefits you qualify for, but your insurance company will let you select the cleaning service that you feel most comfortable with.
              </p>
              <p>
                If your homeowner’s insurance does not defray the cost of our cleaning services, we accept all major credit cards and individual payment plans.&nbsp; Whatever your finances, our team will work with you to choose the best payment option for you.

                Many insurance providers will pay for any clean-up expenses.&nbsp; Our company has established professional relationships with with major insurance providers, allowing us to work directly between each party for your benefit.

              <p>
                Absolutely not.&nbsp; You will always make the final decision when choosing a cleaner.&nbsp; Large insurance companies maintain lists of recommended companies, but they frequently lack the professional know-how required.&nbsp; Our expert cleaning services are unrivaled, but we will never require you to partner with us if you’re not comfortable

              <p>
                While we will never force you to use our services, attempting to clean a crime scene by yourself is never advised.&nbsp; You risk exposing yourself to pathogens and other toxic chemicals that are grave risks to your health.&nbsp; Attempting to restore a site yourself can result in further emotional trauma, something that we would never want to put one of our customers through.

                Numerous dangerous bacteria, chemicals, and particles can jeopardize your health. The emotional distress caused by cleaning up after a loved one’s accident or suicide can have long-term consequences.&nbsp; You deserve to protected from this unnecessary exposure by hiring a certified and professional cleaning service.

                Once fully-cleaned the entire site will be safe for your family and loved ones.&nbsp; Our ultimate goal is to make sure that the scene is devoid of any lingering odors, stains, or soiled surfaces.&nbsp; And if you by chance require any additional cleaning, let us know and we’ll gladly come back for a follow-up consultation.

              <hr>
              <p>
                We do not use bleach during our clean-ups because it doesn’t penetrate carpets, fabrics, and hardwood floors like other professional cleaning solutions.&nbsp; Our team uses a full range of hospital-grade solvents and chemicals that are designed to penetrate lingering stains.&nbsp; These products quickly disinfect and sanitize, leaving the site safe and clean.

              <p>
                Blood and other fluids can easily seep into surfaces, making them undetectable to the naked eye.&nbsp; In order to completely clean a site, our team may have to remove these invisible containments.&nbsp; We’re armed with the tools and cleaning products to take your site back to pre-loss condition.

              <p>
                Police officers, firefighters, paramedics, and law enforcement officials are not legally responsible to clean up after a dramatic loss.&nbsp; That responsibility falls to the homeowner.

            <hr>
              <p>
                The clean-up period will vary greatly depending on the situation.&nbsp; Depending on the scope of the job, what tools we will use, and how many team members it will require, it could range from several hours to several days.&nbsp; After our initial meeting, we will provide you with a complete plan of action, including an estimated time of completion.
