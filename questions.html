          <p><a id="q1"><strong>Who is responsible for paying for cleaning services?</strong></a></p>
            <p>
              Homeowner’s insurance will typically pay for any clean-up costs associated with an accidental death.&nbsp; Contractors are unable to determine which benefits you qualify for, but your insurance company will let you select the cleaning service that you feel most comfortable with.
            </p>
            <p>
              If your homeowner’s insurance does not defray the cost of our cleaning services, we accept all major credit cards and individual payment plans.&nbsp; Whatever your finances, our team will work with you to choose the best payment optio <ans for you.

            <p>
              Many insurance providers will pay for any clean-up expenses.&nbsp; Our company has established professional relationships with with major insurance providers, allowing us to work directly between each party for your benefit.

            <p>
              Absolutely not.&nbsp; You will always make the final decision when choosing a cleaner.&nbsp; Large insurance companies maintain lists of recommended companies, but they frequently lack the professional know-how required.&nbsp; Our expert cleaning services are unrivaled, but we will never require you to partner with us if you’re not comfortable

            <p>
              Offering 24/7 cleaning services, our goal is to arrive on the scene as quickly as possible.&nbsp; Our locally-based technicians are familiar with their respective territories and will work around your schedule, both day and night.&nbsp; We’re here to assist you in whatever way we can.

            <p>
              While we will never force you to use our services, attempting to clean a crime scene by yourself is never advised.&nbsp; You risk exposing yourself to pathogens and other toxic chemicals that are grave risks to your health.&nbsp; Attempting to restore a site yourself can result in further emotional trauma, something that we would never want to put one of our customers through.

            <p>
              Numerous dangerous bacteria, chemicals, and particles can jeopardize your health. The emotional distress caused by cleaning up after a loved one’s accident or suicide can have long-term consequences.&nbsp; You deserve to protected from this unnecessary exposure by hiring a certified and professional cleaning service.

            <p>
              Once fully-cleaned the entire site will be safe for your family and loved ones.&nbsp; Our ultimate goal is to make sure that the scene is devoid of any lingering odors, stains, or soiled surfaces.&nbsp; And if you by chance require any additional cleaning, let us know and we’ll gladly come back for a follow-up consultation.

            <p>
              We do not use bleach during our clean-ups because it doesn’t penetrate carpets, fabrics, and hardwood floors like other professional cleaning solutions.&nbsp; Our team uses a full range of hospital-grade solvents and chemicals that are designed to penetrate lingering stains.&nbsp; These products quickly disinfect and sanitize, leaving the site safe and clean.

            <p>
              Blood and other fluids can easily seep into surfaces, making them undetectable to the naked eye.&nbsp; In order to completely clean a site, our team may have to remove these invisible containments.&nbsp; We’re armed with the tools and cleaning products to take your site back to pre-loss condition.

            <p>
              Police officers, firefighters, paramedics, and law enforcement officials are not legally responsible to clean up after a dramatic loss.&nbsp; That responsibility falls to the homeowner.

            <p>
              The clean-up period will vary greatly depending on the situation.&nbsp; Depending on the scope of the job, what tools we will use, and how many team members it will require, it could range from several hours to several days.&nbsp; After our initial meeting, we will provide you with a complete plan of action, including an estimated time of completion.
