        Our first priority is to ease psychological, emotional, and physical trauma in times of crisis.</p>
      <p>
        Psychological & emotional trauma can be very difficult for people to manage in the loss of a loved one or a tragic accident.
      <p>
      <h2 >Suicide</h2>
      <p>
        The effects of suicidal behavior or completed suicide on friends and family members are often devastating. &nbsp; Individuals who lose a loved one to suicide (suicide survivors) are more at risk for becoming preoccupied with the reason for the suicide while wanting to deny or hide the cause of death, wondering if they could have prevented it, feeling blamed for the problems that preceded the suicide, feeling rejected by their loved one, and stigmatised by others. BDPC has discreet and supportive staff of field technicians.

      <h2>Unattended Death </h2>
      <p>
        An unattended death is when a body has not been discovered for days, weeks, or even months.&nbsp; After the death occurs the body starts to decompose. Decomposition takes place naturally.&nbsp; This process, however, can be the most gruesome of all crime scene cleaning jobs and devastating for a family to find.&nbsp;  Decomposing bodies will leach out biological fluids that seep into the surrounding areas.&nbsp;  These fluids can causing odors, insects, bacteria, and mold.<p>&nbsp</p>

      <h2>Homicide</h2>
      <p>
        After a murder, a family under goes permanent changes that are difficult for the surviving members to accept. After the scene has been released BDPC will remove all evidence of the incident so the constant reminder is no longer present.

      <h2>Industrial Accidents</h2>
      <p>
        It’s critical that all biohazard materials be disposed of and handled by competent BDPC certified technicians complying with OSHA & EPA regulations for the safety of you and others.
      </p>
      <p>
        Business owners, landlords, commercial and industrial properties can endure strong legal issues and lawsuits by employees and other individuals if the area is not properly decontaminated & sanitized by the right personnel, so don’t take the risk!
